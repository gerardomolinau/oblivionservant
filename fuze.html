	<p>"Fuze design" is inspired by the concept of life and death, and how they coexist in harmony. The artist chose to use a skull as the face of the central character, as a reminder of our mortality and the fragility of life. However, the character is not portrayed as fearful or sad, but rather as relaxed and peaceful, enjoying a glass of wine and the company of a tiger. The tiger represents the wild and free spirit of life, as well as the strength and courage to face death.

	<p>The background of "Fuze design" is a stunning depiction of a night sky, transitioning into dawn or dusk. The artist used a variety of colors and strokes to create a realistic and captivating effect. The stars and the sun symbolize the eternal cycle of life and death, and the hope and beauty that can be found in both. The island is a small oasis of greenery and tranquility, contrasting with the vastness and mystery of the sea and the sky. The island also represents the isolation and uniqueness of each individual's life and death.
