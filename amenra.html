	<p>"AMENRA" is inspired by the ancient Egyptian god of the sun, who was often depicted as a falcon or a hawk. The artist chose to use a raven instead, as a symbol of wisdom, power, and mystery. The raven is also associated with death and the underworld, which adds to the ominous and enigmatic atmosphere of the artwork.
